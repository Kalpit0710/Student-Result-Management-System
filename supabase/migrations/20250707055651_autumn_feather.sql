  # Fix RLS policies for proper data access

  1. Security Changes
    - Disable RLS temporarily for data loading
    - Create proper policies that allow data access
    - Re-enable RLS with working policies

  2. Policy Updates
    - Allow public read access for initial data loading
    - Maintain security for write operations
    - Fix authentication flow
